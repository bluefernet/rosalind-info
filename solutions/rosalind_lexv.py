# Problem: Ordering Strings of Varying Length Lexicographically
# Given: A permutation of at most 12 symbols defining an ordered alphabet A and a positive integer n (nâ‰¤4).
# Return: All strings of length at most n formed from A, ordered lexicographically. (Note: alphabet order is based on the order in which the symbols are given.)
